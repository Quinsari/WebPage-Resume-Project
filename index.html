    <br/> My name is Charles Smith and I would love for you to hire me for [INSERT JOB HERE]! <br/>
    <br/>
    I have several important skills to function the best in this job such as communication, willingness to learn, and [JOB SPECIFIC SKILL]. If you don't believe me then take a look at my skills
    section for tons of other super cool things I can do that you may love! Along with these skills I also have projects to showcase and a linked github account in my contact info to really show
    off my whole package. If you still don't believe me then you should leave now and stop hurting my feelings. <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're still here then congratulations for taking the first step in hiring the "BEST" employee you'll ever have! If you feel like your job has what it takes to grab some top tier talent
    such as myself then head over to the contact me page and sign yourself up for the waiting list for me to consider. Once done you'll receive a rejection letter in 2 to 3 business weeks and
    a recommendation to not low-ball me next time. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WORTH SO PAY UP! <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are a current employer looking to see if I am updating my resume and setting my status as open to work, then I assure you that isn't the case and I am perfectly loyal to this company. <br/>
    If you are not a current employer then please ignore the previous statement and hire me as soon as possible to give me an escape from this hell.
